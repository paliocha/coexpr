\title{Cached mutual rank transformation (speed-optimized, parallelized)}
\usage{
mutual_rank_transform_cached_cpp(sim_pcc, n_cores = 1L)
}
\arguments{
\item{sim_pcc}{Symmetric Pearson correlation matrix (n x n)}

\item{n_cores}{Number of OpenMP threads to use (default: 1)}
}
\value{
Mutual rank normalized similarity matrix (n x n) with values in range 0 to 1
}
\description{
Transforms a Pearson correlation matrix into a PCC+MR similarity matrix
using the mutual rank normalization from Obayashi & Kinoshita (2009).
}
\details{
This implementation precomputes all row ranks once, then uses them for
the mutual rank computation. This is faster than the streaming approach
but uses more memory (O(n^2) for the rank matrix).

Memory usage: O(n^2) for input + O(n^2) for ranks + O(n^2) for output = 3 matrices
Time complexity: O(n^2 log n) for ranking + O(n^2) for transformation

Since the input PCC matrix is symmetric, column ranks equal transposed row ranks.
This allows us to precompute row ranks once and reuse them efficiently.

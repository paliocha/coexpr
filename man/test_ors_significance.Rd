\title{Test significance of ORS}
\usage{
test_ors_significance(ors_results, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{ors_results}{Data frame from \code{calculate_ors()}}

\item{alpha}{Significance level (default 0.05)}
}
\value{
Input data frame with added column \code{significant} (logical)
}
\description{
Tests whether an ortholog pair has significantly conserved co-expression
compared to random expectation.
}
\details{
The null hypothesis is that the ortholog has no more conserved co-expression
than a random gene pair. This corresponds to ORS = 0.5 (median rank).

The alternative hypothesis is that ORS > 0.5 (better than median).
